## Play-Angul
Angular is a development platform for building mobile and desktop web applications.

The Play Framework combines productivity and performance making it easy to build scalable web applications with Java and Scala. Play is developer friendly with a "just hit refresh" workflow and built-in testing support. With Play, applications scale predictably due to a stateless and non-blocking architecture. By being RESTful by default, including assets compilers, JSON & WebSocket support, Play is a perfect fit for modern web & mobile applications.

We integrate these two platform(Angular2 as frontend and Play! for backend)
